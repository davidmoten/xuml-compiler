#summary Guide to using xUmlCompiler

==Introduction==
This guide shows you how to define, view, generate and execute a system using xUmlCompiler.

==Setup==
Checkout the latest version and run the build.xml file with ant (works fine with 1.7). This creates the xuml-compiler.jar and dowloads its dependencies from Maven repositories.

Include the jars below in your classpath:
  * xUmlCompiler/temp/deployment/xuml-compiler.jar
  * xUmlCompiler/temp/dependencies/`*`.jar

==Create a system==
Here are the steps required to create a system:
  # Define a system
  # View/validate the system
  # Generate the EJBs
  # Include the generated EJBs in your runtime classpath
  # Implement the Action interfaces for those entities that have actions.
  # Create an injector module

To run the system:
  # Setup the injector
  # Run your code
