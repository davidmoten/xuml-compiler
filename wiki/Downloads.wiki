The project binaries (jars) can be found in the maven repository for this project:
  http://xuml-compiler.googlecode.com/svn/repo

The preferred technique is to use the maven dependencies as detailed in the example poms. Add the repository to your pom.xml or settings.xml like so:
{{{
 <repositories>
   <repository>
     <id>xuml-compiler-repo</id>
     <name>xuml-compiler</name>
     <url>http://xuml-compiler.googlecode.com/svn/repo/</url>
   </repository>
  </repositories>
}}}

Note that a lot of work is taking place at the 0.4.8-SNAPSHOT level and that while that is the latest version it's recommended to do an svn checkout and build and install artifacts locally using maven. See [Guide].
