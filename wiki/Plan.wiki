#summary Project Plan

  * rewrite saving and loading of Class Diagram Viewer .ini files (needs a clean up), perhaps use ecore defined data model
  * create a State Machine Viewer
  * use `ImportContext` in template files to collate the import declarations
  * junit tests for Specialization
  * more junit tests for multiplicity combinations
  ~~* automate validation (maven can probably pulll down all the necessary OSGi modules, just got to give it a go).~~
