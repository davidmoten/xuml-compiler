#summary Project Plan

  * rewrite saving and loading of Class Diagram Viewer .ini files (just to clean it up), perhaps use ecore defined data model
  * create a State Viewer
  * use `ImportContext` in template files to collate the import declarations
  * test Specialization
  * more unit tests for multiplicity combinations
  * automate validation (maven can probably pulll down all the necessary OSGi modules, just got to give it a go).
