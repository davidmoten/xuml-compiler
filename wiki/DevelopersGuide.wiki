== Checkout into Eclipse ==
Using Eclipse 3.5.1 and Subversive plugin, add a new SVN repository with location 
 https://xuml-compiler.googlecode.com/svn
add your username (without the @gmail.com) and the password from [http://code.google.com/p/xuml-compiler/source/checkout Source - Checkout].

In the SVN Repository Perspective, 
  # Open up the xuml-compiler repository
  # Right mouse on _trunk_ and select _Find/Checkout As..._
  # Select _Find projects in the children of the selected resource_
  # Click _Finish_
  # In the next dialog tick _Respect project hierarchy_ and click _Finish_. 

Then go to the Java perspective and to the Run button. Run _xuml-compiler-parent clean install_. That will build all the xuml compiler projects and on completion will refresh the workspace.

That's it, all projects built and installed in the local repository ready for more changes.
