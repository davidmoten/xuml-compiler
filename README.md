So you are a java programmer, you have a data model (a Class Diagram) and you want to implement your system?

Get your State Machines sorted, then you can specify a system to xUmlCompiler, and validate, test and execute it.

The result is an executable system so that we satisfy to a fair degree that _"the model is the code"_.

[Overview], [Guide], [Example1Simple QuickStart], [Plan]

For background 
 * [Executable UML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_UML) at Wikipedia.
 * [Executable UML](http://books.google.com.au/books?id=zBS0aWNjBqcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=mellor+balcer&sig=d0MsWNbJjscwjy4Uj1w6YZls-uc) (Mellor & Balcer, 2002) at Google Books

In detail, a system specified in java code using helper methods provided by xUmlCompiler is used to generate java persistence annotated (JPA) classes. [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice) is used to inject action language (java) for methods and events. xUmlCompiler offers a swing viewer for the system and generates persistence.xml resources for quick testing turnaround. 

**Note** that a completely reworked model compiler is at http://github.com/davidmoten/xuml-tools. The primary difference is a reworked metamodel in accordance with Leon Starr's work and support for concurrency.

**Features**
* uses hibernate 5.x
* requires Java 8
* compatible with Java 11, 17
* slf4j logging
