==Mumble==
Mumble is a java code generator in the style of ''Executable UML'' (Mellor and Balcer, 2002)

Mumble can generate a fully executable persistent system as defined by 
* UML Class Diagram 
* UML State Machine
Action Language is written in java classes implementing state entry procedures and class operations which is then injected into entity beans when required by a Guice injection module.

===Features ===
For each entity Mumble creates
* Interface class
* Ejb annotated Implementation class
* Actions interface class (to be implemented by the injected actions class written externally)
* Event classes as static nested classes of the interface class
* Search class as a static nested class of the interface class

Actions
* all state machine entry methods are in the actions interface
* all class operations (methods) are in the actions interface

Search
* every index and identifier is represented with a specific search method

Entity instantiation is only available through static create methods on a package level ObjectFactory class. This forces creation of objects in conjunction with the injector.
